# Product-Performance-Resource-Allocation-Analysis-for-Kashier

## Project Description
In this data analysis project, I was tasked with evaluating the performance of Kashier's three transaction products—Point-of-Sale, Payment Pages, and Payment Requests—to inform strategic resource allocation. Using transaction data from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021, I analyzed key metrics such as transaction volume, total processed amount, revenue per transaction, and overall revenue per product. The goal was to identify which product demonstrated the highest growth potential and return on investment.

## Project Outcome
- Identified High-Growth Product: Determined which product had the most significant growth potential based on transaction volume and revenue metrics.
- Revenue Analysis: Calculated the total revenue generated by each product, considering both flat fees and percentage-based rates.
- Strategic Recommendations: Provided data-driven recommendations for reallocating resources to the most promising product to maximize growth and profitability.
